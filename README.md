## Overview
Most existing stock related websites or applications are either trading platforms or information providers. One of their common grounds is that they are all loaded with intimidating jargons which baffle non-professional investors. Stock 101 is a project that meant to help amatuer stock investors set foot in stock investments. The most important feature of Stock 101 is that we add beginner-friendly yet comprehensive explanations to every term that users may encounter in our app. We name it "Educational Clickable". We also add a metric system to evaluate the business of a company by introducing four tables reflecting business growth, profitability, management efficiency and financial health respectively. Five years of historical financial statements of the business are also provided for easy access and easy analysis.
