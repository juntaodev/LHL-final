                  <p className="py-2">The closing price is the raw price or cash value of the last transacted price in a security before the market officially closes for normal trading. It is often the reference point used by investors to compare a stock's performance since the previous dayâ€”and closing prices are frequently used to construct line graphs depicting historical price changes over time.</p>
                  <p className="py-2">Closing prices are useful markers for investors to use to assess changes in stock prices over time. Even in the era of 24-hour trading, there is a closing price for any stock or other security, and it is the final price at which it trades during regular market hours on any given day. The closing price is considered the most accurate valuation of a stock or other security until trading resumes on the next trading day.</p>
                  <p className="py-2">The closing price on one day can be compared to the closing price on the previous day, 30 days earlier or a year earlier, to measure the changes in market sentiment toward that stock. Most stock news sites allow investors to chart closing prices for a period of years, and typically since the day the company went public.</p>

                  <p className="py-2">One way that day traders and technical analysts use today's high, along with today's low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock's price with no trading in between those two prices.</p>

                  <p className="py-2">One way that day traders use today's low along with today's high is to identify gaps, or sudden jumps up or down in a stock's price with no trading in between. Gaps are used in technical analysis to identify directional movement, average true range/price volatility, candlestick patterns and more. Traders then analyze these patterns to determine profitable entry and exit points. Traders can also use benchmarks such as today's low to assess a stock's value or try to predict trends.</p>

Higher trade volumes for a specified security mean higher liquidity, better order execution and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller. When investors feel hesitant about the direction of the stock market, futures trading volume tends to increase, which often causes options and futures on specified securities to trade more actively. Volume overall tends to be higher near the market's opening and closing times, and on Mondays and Fridays. It tends to be lower at lunchtime and before a holiday.</p>

                  <p className="py-2">The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for the security. Often, a stock may actually breach a 52-week high intraday, but end up closing below the previous 52-week high, thereby going unrecognized.

The rationale behind this strategy is that if a price breaks out from its 52-week range (either above or below that range), there must be some factor that generated enough momentum to continue the price movement in the same direction.

                  <p className="py-2">When average daily trading volume (ADTV) increases or decreases dramatically, it signals that there has been a substantial shift in how people value or view the asset. Usually, higher average daily trading volume means that the security is more competitive, has narrower spreads and is typically less volatile. Stocks tend to be less volatile when they have higher average daily trading volumes because much larger trades would have to be made to affect the price. This does not mean a stock with high volume won't have large daily price moves. On any single day (or over multiple days) any stock could have a very large price move, on higher than average volume.</p>
                  <p className="py-2">The average daily trading volume is an often-cited security trading measurement and a direct indication of a security's overall liquidity. The higher the trading volume is for a security, the more buyers and sellers there are in the market which makes it is easier and faster to execute a trade. Without a reasonable level of market liquidity, transaction costs are likely to become higher (due to larger spreads).</p>
                  <p className='py-2'>Average daily trading volume is a useful tool for analyzing the price action of any liquid asset. If the price of an asset is rangebound and a breakout occurs, increasing volume tends to confirm that breakout. A lack of volume indicates the breakout may fail.</p>
                  <p className='py-2'>Volume also helps confirm price moves either higher or lower. During strong price pushes up or down, volume should also rise. If it isn't, there may not be enough interest to keep pushing the price. If there isn't enough interest then the price may pullback.</p>
                  <p className='py-2'>During trends, pullbacks with low volume tend to favor the price eventually moving in the trending direction again. For example, in an uptrend, volume will often rise when the price is rising strongly. If the stock pulls back and volume is low, it shows that there isn't much selling interest. If the price starts to move up on higher volume again, that can be a favorable entry point as price and volume are both confirming the uptrend.</p>
                  <p className='py-2'>When volume is well above average, it sometimes indicates a climax of the price move. So many shares have changed hands in a certain price area that there may be no one else to step in and keep pushing the price in that direction. Steep price moves coupled with steep volume increases can often be a sign of an imminent price reversal.</p>
